                                                MFCC Feature Extraction for Speech Signals


The code for MFCC feature extraction was written in Python, Version-3. The code was obtained from relevant online sources. Jupyter environment was used to compile and run the code to get the desired output.

The libraries used in the code were:

1.‘librosa’ : For audio processing and MFCC extraction
2.‘matplotlib’ : For plotting MFCC features
3.‘numpy’ : For numerical operations.

The above mentioned libraries are not preinstalled in Jupyter by default.
We need to install these packages separately in the Jupyter environment. To install the libraries, we need to use the following commands in the Jupyter environment:

1.  To intall ‘librosa’:
       
!pip install librosa

2.   To install ‘numpy’ :
        
        !pip install numpy

3.   To install ‘matplotlib’ :

        !pip install matplotlib
